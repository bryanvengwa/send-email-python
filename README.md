Purpose:

This Python script sends an email using Gmail's SMTP server. It leverages the smtplib, email.mime.text, and email.mime.multipart modules to construct a MIME email object and send it securely.

Before You Run:

Security: Avoid storing sensitive credentials like passwords directly in the code. Instead, use environment variables or secure configuration files.
Email Account: Ensure you're using a Gmail account that allows app passwords for less secure apps. Create one by following Google's instructions: [[invalid URL removed]]([invalid URL removed])
App Password: Generate an app password for your Gmail account and replace your app name in the code with it. Keep this password confidential.
Code Breakdown:

Imports:

smtplib: Connects to the SMTP server.
email.mime.text: Creates plain text email content.
email.mime.multipart: Creates a multipart email structure.
Email Configuration:

sender_email: Your Gmail address.
receiver_email: The recipient's email address.
subject: The email subject line.
body: The email body content.
MIME Object Creation:

message: Creates a MIME multipart object for the email.
message["From"], message["To"], message["Subject"]: Sets the sender, recipient, and subject headers.
message.attach(MIMEText(body, "plain")): Attaches the plain text body to the email.
SMTP Connection and Login:

smtp_server: Gmail's SMTP server address (smtp.gmail.com).
smtp_port: The SMTP port used by Gmail (587).
username: Your Gmail address. Replace your email username with your actual address.
password: Replace your app name with the app password generated earlier.
with smtplib.SMTP(...) as server: Establishes a secure connection to the SMTP server using a context manager.
server.starttls(): Enables TLS encryption for secure communication.
server.login(username, password): Logs in to the SMTP server using your credentials.
Send Email and Print Confirmation:

server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message.as_string()): Sends the email to the recipient.
print("done"): Prints a confirmation message.
Additional Notes:

This code is designed for educational purposes. Use it responsibly and ethically.
Consider using a dedicated email library like smtplib-tls for improved security and features.
Always test your code thoroughly before sending emails to real recipients.
